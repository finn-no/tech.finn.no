    <p>The annual <a href="http://smidig2011.no/">Smidig conference</a> in Oslo, Norway was held last week and as usual people from FINN.no made a big contribution to the conference. We hade three lightening talks during the two day conference and there were about ten attendants in total. This community event brings together newbies and veterans of agile software development for two days of lightning talks and open space sessions. We all had a great time at the conference and are very much looking forward to next years conference.</p>

<p>Our three lightning talks spanned from a Norwegian version of over to a talk showing how we transformed our customer service team and the last one about how you need to measure in order to achieve the full effect of agile processes. You can check out the videos below, but be warned they are all in Norwegian.</p>

<h2>Transforming our customer services team</h2>

<p>Jo Anders Heir held a talk about how we have worked to transform our customer service team from being a shield preventing customer feedback from reaching product organization into a megafon which blasts information throughout the organization. It shows how simple software and processes can help you make sure you work on what really matters for you users and customers.</p>

<h2>Measure KPI's, iterate and release. The three things you need to do to succeseed with agile</h2>

<p>Arve Søreide talked about three things you need to do in order to achieve the desired effects from using agile methods. You need to mease Key Performance Indicators while you iterate and release frequently. Only then can you harvest the big benefits from using agile methods.</p>

<h2>An end to negativity - Norwegian style</h2>

<p>This talk was originally held by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/voodootikigod">Chris William</a> at <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2011/">JSConf EU 2011</a> and you should check out <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2011/an_end_to_negativity.html">the original version of An End To Negativity</a>.</p>

<p>A big thanks from all of us at FINN.no to the crew who's hard work made this years conference a huge success. See you all again next year!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>FINN.no has recently released new pages for real estate ads. Larger images, broker business cards and tabs for additional information are some of the new features on this page. A long process of in-depth users interviews, workshops with real estate brokers, user testing of design sketches and several sprints of development, we are proud to finally see the new pages on <a href="http://www.finn.no/">www.finn.no</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/result??sort=3">Pick a nice home from this list to view the ads</a>
Cut the general crap - show me the business cards!</p>

<h2>What's in it for the user?</h2>

<p><a href="http://tech.finn.no/2011/10/14/make-real-estate-brokers-happy-with-hard-boiled-business-cards/full_ad/"><img src="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/full_ad-264x600.jpg" alt="" /></a>Larger images and the possibility to navigate through images without leaving the page were the first thing that was noticed, and liked, during our user testing sessions. For a full size view of 900 pixel images we have still kept a link to our old image viewing page. However, after release we have got feedback from many users who failed to find this link and complain that images are smaller. There is still work to be done to improve this.</p>

<p>The information about the home is divided into primary and secondary information. The prime information, like price, area, address and viewings, is put at the top of the page, so the user won't need to scroll to find it. More detailed information, like facilities, plot size and descriptions is located below the prime information and the image viewing module.</p>

<p>Secondary information is integrated by tabs. Fakta (facts) is the default tab, containing information about the estate from the broker. Prisstatistikk (price statistics) is highlights from Eiendomspulsen, which displays information like average price per square meter in the area and prices for previous sales of the actual estate. Neighborhood profile is an additional service brokers may add to their prospects with information about nearby services, schools and demographics.</p>

<h2>What's in it for the broker?</h2>

<p>Realestate brokers have requested more options for building brand awareness in the prospect. To meet this request our designers suggested the brokers may design their own business cards for their contact information and to use their profile colors at some other elements on the page. They may also offer their services after the last image in the image gallery and in a tab next to Price statistics and Neighborhood profile. Interviews with users indicate that information from the broker won't be regarded as ordinary banner ads as long as they provide information that is relevant for users who are in the process of changing their home. Krogsveen (a major realestate agent in Norway) has taken good advantage of this banner position by listing properties they have recently sold in the same area.</p>

<h2>How to make the business cards</h2>

<p>There are three ways to display the broker's contact information. Basic prospects have a simple listing of name, position, phone and fax numbers along with a company logo. Brokers who are using expanded prospects, which are prospects with the broker's own set of banners, have their contact information styled as a business card. Brokers may customize these cards with their own css, background image and a picture of the broker.</p>

<p>Some prospects have two brokers listed, but to save space only one broker is visible at the time. In expanded prospects business cards will swap when the user click a looping arrow or the card in the back. In basic prospects the name of the other broker slide in when clicking the "more contact persons" link. Jquery animation is used to swap the cards and CSS transitions is used for the sliding of contacts in basic prospects.</p>

<p>The markup is the same for all levels of contact information, supporting the hcard microformat, while there are three layers of css. Styling of the contact information on basic prospects is in the main css file. Default business cards are styled by using a seperate css file which adds the business card look and overrides the default css where necessary. Customized business cards are styled by a third layer of css, which overrides the classes from the default card to add a background image and their company's colors and fonts.</p>

<p>By the time of release we had 13 different customized business cards on our prospects.</p>

<h3>Contact information for a basic prospect</h3>

<p>HTML code for a business card looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;address id="flip_0" class="vcard flip  backgroundimage"&gt;
  &lt;a href="(url)" class="orglogo" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="(url)" alt="Utleiemegleren Sinsen" border="0" class="logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;span class="fn n brokerName"&gt;Karianne Johannessen&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="ul"&gt;
    &lt;span class="li title brokerTitle"&gt;Supermegler&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="li brokerPhoneHolder"&gt;
      &lt;dl class="tel brokerPhone"&gt;
        &lt;dt class="type hideText"&gt;Work&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dt class="displayText"&gt;Telefon&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dd class="value"&gt;22 79 66 26&lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;/dl&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="li brokerMobilHolder"&gt;
      &lt;dl class="tel brokerMobil"&gt;
        &lt;dt class="type hideText"&gt;Cell&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dt class="displayText"&gt;Mobil&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dd class="value"&gt;48133956&lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;/dl&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="li brokerFaxHolder"&gt;
      &lt;dl class="tel brokerFax"&gt;
        &lt;dt class="type hideText"&gt;Fax&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dt class="type"&gt;Faks&lt;/dt&gt;
        &lt;dd class="value"&gt;22796601&lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;/dl&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="li brokerEmail"&gt;
      &lt;a data-click-mt="mailto" href="(url)" class="click-track"&gt;Send epost&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;div class="clearall"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the basic css for contact information:</p>

<pre><code>.contact {overflow: hidden; width: 330px;}
.contact .cardWrapper {position: relative; width: 700px;}
.contact address {-moz-transition: left 0.7s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition: left 0.7s ease-in-out; -o-transition: left 0.7s ease-in-out; -ms-transition: left 0.7s ease-in-out; transition: left 0.7s ease-in-out;
    background-color:#FFFFFF; display:block; float:left; font-style:normal; position:relative; width:330px;}
.contact .hideText {display: none;}
.contact .orglogo {float: right;}
.contact .brokerName {display:block; font-size:12px; font-weight:normal; margin:0;}
.contact .li {clear: left; display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;}
.contact dt {float: left; padding-right: 0.5em;}
.contact dd {float: left;}
.contact .moreContacts {float:left; width:330px; text-align:right; margin-bottom:20px; }
.contact address {left:0;}
.contact address.backCard {position:relative; left:360px;}
.contact address +  address {left:-330px;}
.contact address + address.backCard {left:30px}
</code></pre>

<h3>Default styling of a business card</h3>

<p>This is the second layer of css which forms a basic business card:</p>

<pre><code>#flip_0{z-index:1; top:0; left:0;}
#flip_1{z-index:0; top:20px; left:15px;}
.contact .flip.backCard {cursor:pointer; background:#f3f3f3; display:block; transform: rotate(3deg);-o-transform: rotate(3deg);

.contact .flip.backCard:hover {background:#ffffff;}
.contact .cardWrapper {position:relative; min-height:195px; width:auto;}
.contact .spacer {height:25px; display:block; clear:both;}
.contact .flip{position:absolute; background-color:white;}
.contact address {box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px 0 #cccccc; padding:10px; width:300px; height:150px; border: #eeeeee solid 1px; float:none; overflow:hidden;
    -moz-transition: none;-webkit-transition: none;-o-transition: none;transition: none;-ms-transition: none;}
.contact address .brokerPhoto {float:left; max-height:100px; max-width:75px; margin: 15px 10px 0 0; display:block;}
.contact .brokerName {font-size:16px; font-weight:normal; margin-top:15px}
.contact img.brokerPhoto~ul {max-width:190px}
.contact .orglogo img {position:absolute; bottom:10px; right:10px;max-height:100px; max-width:100px; }
.contact .moreContacts {display:none;}
.contact img.moreContacts  {float:right; position:absolute; top:0; right:-12px; display:block; cursor:pointer; width:14px; height:22px}
.contact .ul {float: left; display:block;}

<h2>The feedback</h2>

<p>Three weeks after the release we have recieved 1060 feedbacks, 630 positive, 374 negative and 56 indifferent. This is actually better feedback than we are used to after releasing such a radical redesign. Our biggest challenge is to make it easier to view images in full size. For other layout issues it seems like people simply need some time to get used to it. I have seen no complaints from users who dislikes the business cards, which was one of our biggest concerns before the release.</p>

<p>Our analyzing tools tell us that the average viewing time on this page before the release was 33 seconds. After the release of the new design the viewing time has increased to 1 minute and 15 seconds, at the expense of the image viewing page, which page views has dropped rapidly. The number of page views of the ad page has also dropped, probably because of less navigation to and from the image viewing page. However, the number of visits on the ad page seems to be stable.</p>

  url=/behind%20the%20scenes/2011/09/02/how-to-get-a-job-at-finn-no.html
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date">2011-09-02 08:08:46 UTC</span>
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>If you're a student or just someone who is looking for a job you might be wondering: "How could I get to work for FINN.no?". One guy found an answer and is now one of the key developers on our iOS applications. We did an advert for summer interns last year and he was one of the people who came in to do some proof of concept work on iOS. The end result was an iPad application that never hit the AppStore, but for one of the participant this internship was the first step towards landing a job as a developer at FINN.no.</p>

<p>What made you apply for the summer internship at FINN.no?</p>

<pre><code>It all started with my university teacher pointed out that FINN.no had an open internship during the summer. At first I did not want to apply, because I wanted to have vacation all summer (Like all other informatics students). However, I ended up with applying and just a few hours later I got a call; the internship was mine! The main reason to apply for the internship was that I was finishing my master’s degree and was lacking work experience in the field of informatics. Secondly, I did not know that much about FINN.no and I could always need the extra money :)
</code></pre>

<p>What did you learn during that summer?</p>

<pre><code>I learned that FINN.no is not just a big website, it is also a big company. And there are not just developers at FINN.no, but also a range of different jobs (Like finance, marketing, economics and so on). When taking about the technical aspects I learned how to develop for the iPhone/iPad. Furthermore, I learned that to get things working you are depended on a range of different "teams" to develop what you need. And this is not always trivial, because all "teams" have their own focus areas and problems. So you never work independent!
</code></pre>

<p>What was it like to be a summer intern at FINN.no?</p>

<pre><code>It was both interesting and rich on experiences. The one thing I want to point out is how the atmosphere and the peoples at FINN.no are. The atmosphere is comfortable and "chill" and the people are welcoming and easy to talk with. They want to teach you what they know and want to learn about what you know.
</code></pre>

<p>How did you do about landing the position at FINN.no?</p>

<pre><code>Firstly, I work hard during the summer and tried my best to present what I could do. Before I left FINN.no that summer I was told that if I needed a part time work, I should just ask and they would see what they could give me.  After the summer internship was completed I went back to school for a few months. Some time before Christmas I sent my supervisor at FINN.no a e-mail and ask if it was possible to get a 50% position at the company the last 6 months of my masters degree. 1. January I started with working part time at FINN.no and before I completed my degree I was presented with a full time position at FINN.no.
</code></pre>

<p>What have you been doing since you came to work for FINN.no?</p>

<pre><code>I have been continuing learning objective-c and iOS. Furthermore have I learned more about designing projects, completing them and how to work with other development teams (To get our hands on the right APIs we needed in the iOS app). One example is the new iOS app, FINN Torget annonse innleggning", that FINN.no released a week ago.
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between working with school assignments and working at a company?</p>

<pre><code>The biggest difference must be that a school assignment is something that will never be used by any persons. So you just complete it because you must, and not because you want to. In a company as big as FINN.no your applications will be used by a lot of peoples. You must always perform your best to please all of the users. Because of this you want to stay on the edge of new technology and learn more.
</code></pre>

<p>What's your advice for other young developers out there wanting to work for the coolest company in Norway?</p>

<pre><code>You must work hard and make them see you in the crowd. If a new internship opens up do not think twice just apply. Before you know it, you are placed in my position to answer a few questions in a interview like this one.
</code></pre>

<p>Anything you want to add?</p>

<pre><code>I love how they work at FINN.no, a lot of very smart people and it feels like peoples at FINN.no don't stress that much!
</code></pre>

<p>And peoples at FINN.no do know how to create a party ;)

    <p><img src="http://www.midwestwebsense.com/av/wordle-med.png" alt="Web Standards tag cloud" /></p>

<p>I was introduced to the World Wide Web back in 1995 while being a student at <a href="http://www.himolde.no/">Molde College, Norway</a>. What fascinated me the most was that I could learn how to create stuff for the web by just viewing the source code of other web sites. This blew my mind and since then I have built a career working with web development.</p>

<p>Creating web sites and web-based applications for me has always been about trying to adopt the latest technological advances in browsers, as soon as they were available. Naturally, this has lead to me reaching a few dead ends (IE’s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531388(v=vs.85">Data Binding</a>.asp) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Style_Sheets">Netscape JavaScript style sheets</a>), but mostly it has enabled me to create some pretty cool things.</p>

<h1>From DHTML to an atomic winter</h1>

<p>In the days of the .com era, the community for creating web based applications was buzzing. We were cranking out all kinds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML">DHTML</a>  magic. Every site out there was jumping on the band wagon without any hesitation. One of the classics is online retailer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo.com">Boo.com</a> which went all out with new technology without really succeeding. Naturally we had to deal with older browsers then too, but we did not let that get in the way of using the latest standards being adopted in browsers.</p>

<p>The burst of the .com bubble created something of an atomic winter as far as web based user interface development goes. A lot of people lost their jobs and the rest of us took refuge in server side development.</p>

<h1>A clean slate and a new dawn</h1>

<p>Thankfully all the bad stuff was swiftly cleaned up with the introduction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming">AJAX approach by Jesse James Garret in 2005</a>). All the interface developers came out from their hiding places and they sure had been busy during that atomic winter. Out popped all kinds of amazing things like <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI Library</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>. Once more the web moved forward at a rapid pace thanks to the newly found fame due to the AJAX hype. JavaScript was getting recognition as an actual language and CSS was being implemented in a more serious manner than before.</p>

<p>We all implemented our applications and sites using HTML, JavaScript and CSS2 and felt good about it. However it is worth noting that CSS2 was not a finished specification and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Difficulty_with_adoption">no browser has yet to implement the entire CSS2 specification</a>. Still, we have used loads of what is in CSS2 for years.</p>

<h1>HTML5 - a new generation of web developers</h1>

<p>Lulling in the wake of AJAX a new generation of web developers entered the scene. <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">The WHATWG</a> decided to take matters into their own hands and do what the W3C seemed incapable of, creating something which made creating web based applications with HTML easier. With the new hype of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> we started to get all kinds of, what I thought, strange questions on blogs, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and in industry media. “When can I start using HTML5?”, “When will it be ready?”, “I am so disappointed, all this hype and I can not use it”.</p>

<p>All these questions struck me as very odd and I was beginning to think there was something wrong with me, had I missed something? I had never heard these kinds of questions before regarding CSS, JavaScript or HTML. Sure, we had to take into consideration that not all browsers supported everything in the same manner. But that was what we as web developer did, right? We create web based applications using the best technology available to us meanwhile making sure older less capable browsers could view it to. This is what got my career started and what I have spent a lot of time doing as a living.</p>

<p>This new generation of developers seemed to be very focused upon only applying technology which where in standards that where finished.  To me this sounded weird as we have never once before had any hesitation as to adopt new technology when it was available to us. When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XmlHttpRequest</a> object was missing in browsers, what did we do? We used the <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/IFrame_Call">old trick of the hidden IFrame</a>. Back when <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>’s JavaScript support was horrendous (luckily this is no longer the case) what did we do? We made sure our stuff worked without the use of JavaScript. If something was not a final specification or something was not implemented in all browsers we implemented fallback solutions or provided alternate experiences.</p>

<h1>Our bread and butter</h1>

<p>Creating web applications using the latest technologies available to us should be our bread and butter as web developers. We should not wait around for the W3C to put some stamp on some documents. Browser vendors drive innovation, not standards bodies and therefor we should apply the technology being made available to us as quickly as we can, while making sure those with less capable browsers also can access our service or site. HTML5 does not make this any harder than before and we should not use the lack of a finalized HTML5 specification hold us back.</p>

<h1>Web Standards are everything</h1>

<p>You might be tempted into thinking that web standards are not that important, after all the browser vendors drive innovation. Innovation is done by the vendors, but the standards are extremely important as a way of making sure the web stays open and does not become fragmented. There are always numerous organizations trying to create their own special web, but thanks to the great work of the standard bodies the web has stayed open and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>The web standards (such as <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">The Web Standards Project</a> and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>) community has really blossomed in the years after the introduction of AJAX and developers are way more conscious about the importance open standards. Without the work of the people in various working groups and standard bodies we would not be where we are today. Web technology is being used in more innovative ways than ever before. Not only restricted to making content or applications for the web, but also on the server side or to create native mobile applications.</p>

<p>In summary the web standards are not important, but still they are essential for us to continue to enjoy all the amazing service and applications created with open web technology.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In the post <a href="http://tech.finn.no/2011/05/09/putting-a-face-on-quality/">Putting a face on quality</a> we talked about how we wanted to bring our end users closer to our developers by visualizing tweets about our service. This was only one of many tasks we performed in order to get a better feel on how our work effects our users. In this post we'll show you what we did in order to put numbers on end user quality by working with out customer service team.</p>

<p>Up until now our customer service team had a hard time visualizing the effect our code had on end users. They where publishing numbers on number of incoming requests, but these numbers where on a weekly basis at best.</p>

<h1>Research in the wild</h1>

<p>Therefor we set out with the goal of making all support requests visible in real time for the entire organization. Out hypothesis was that this would provide everyone on our teams from developers, product owners and sales staff with a clear view on what kind of quality they deliver.<a href="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/desk02.png"><img src="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/desk02-300x224.png" alt="" /></a>
In order to figure out what our application should look like we set out to see what the reality was and sat with our customer service team to see how they worked. But they had no system in place for logging requests and what area of our service it was about. All we had was the statistics from our support ticket system and call center. These systems did not provide enough detailed information, therefor our Lean task force team encouraged them to start logging requests on paper then put it all into a set of Excel spread sheets. Needless to say this required quite a bit of effort from the people one the customer service team and it was not a solution for the long term.
<a href="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/desk01.png"><img src="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/desk01-300x224.png" alt="" /></a>
When deciding how to approach creating a application for logging requests we looked at how the analog logging process was performed. Realizing that a request could be for more than one problem area and effect multiple teams we realized that the paper layout was in fact ideal. We created a quick prototype in HTML and had the users test it. This prototype had no persistence and did only show how the process of logging a request would look and feel. We didn't create anything else as this would've been waste if we where not to proceed with the application. By not building anything besides what was absolutely necessary we where able do deliver quickly (3-4 days) and we had no inventory which would become waste if our prototype didn't match what our end users required.
For simultaneous testing of the prototype we compared against an off the shelf product which used a wizard style approach to logging requests. Both prototypes was tested by the customer service team and the results where clear: the flexibility of the paper layout performed way better as it was quick and non-intrusive.</p>

<h1>The penalty of success</h1>

<p>With the success of the prototype we were now expected to deliver a solution which actually persisted the data and had a set of reports which would help visualize the requests coming in from our customers.</p>

<p>The application has to be delivered to the team actually responsible for all our back office applications and so this put some requirements on which technologies to use. We develop most of our services with Java so this would be the choice for the back end. On our mobile web solution m.finn.no we use RestEasy to provide a REST interface for our one-page JavaScript front end, therefor this would be the choice for our application as well. Along with Spring/Spring JDBC and a MySQL database this was our back end. We specifically opted for conservative technology choices as we wanted to hand over to be as smooth as possible.
On the client side we opted to do a one page application written in JavaScript with the help of jQuery and a custom made publish-subscribe library along with Mustache for templating in our JS code.</p>

<h1>Your friendly neighborhood log application</h1>

<p>The only requirement from the customer was that it had to be effortless to log entries into our system. "There should be no reason not to log entries into the system". We adopted what we call a "angstfri brukeropplevelse", which translates into something like an anguish-free user experience.
Everything else was pretty much up to us to decide. The grid based layout inherited from the analog log was a success. Therefor all we added was keyboard navigation and a cross hair behavior which provided the user with an easier way of seeing which column they where in to help avoid invalid log entries. We specifically avoided any kind of validation or other kinds of business rules as this would only make the threshold for logging a bit higher and this was not acceptable.</p>

<p>Having added a back-end and enhanced the user experience we did an initial test as soon as possible to get feedback on reports. A couple of tries later we where in production.</p>

<h1>Quality ~= Visibility + Skills</h1>

<p>Why did our architects set out to create an application for our customer service team you may ask? We focus upon enhancing the quality of what we deliver to our users and customers. Making sure everyone in our organization knows exactly how our work affect our users is one of the most important ways to make sure quality is always at the forefront in everything we do. This is why we used a couple of weeks to create this application. To quote some of the engineers at Facebook: "we want to bring your mother close to our developers". We want everyone to feel that their mom is their users and who wants their mom to experience bugs or errors?</p>

<p><a href="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Awesomeboard-Mark-II-2.png"><img src="http://tech.finn.no/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Awesomeboard-Mark-II-2-300x129.png" alt="" /></a>In order to make things visible we needed to iterate over our previous solution which visualized tweets about us on Twitter. We did a redesign and integrated some key figures into the application and the end result became really awesome, hence the name Awesome Board II.
There is still one more piece of the plan for visualizing quality and it will be discussed in a later post. However you can view it on some of our pages already.</p>
