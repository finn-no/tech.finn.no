Developers at FINN blogging about tech. 
You can also find us on Twitter [@FINN_tech](https://twitter.com/finn_tech).

## Quick start

We are using Jekyll. Read more about it [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).
You need Ruby to run the project. It will work out of the box on Mac.
If you are on another platform check out the [installation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

```sh
$ gem install bundler # only needed once
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

These commands may not work out of the box if you have the wrong version of Ruby installed. You could try to upgrade to the latest Ruby version, and then run the following.

```sh
$ gem update --system
$ gem update bundler
```


Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.

If you want to preview drafts run with the '--drafts' flag

## Operating system specific notes

I had to reinstall ruby-dev on Ubuntu 16.04 in WSL:
```
apt install build-essential
apt install ruby2.3-dev --reinstall
```
to get `ruby.h` in the right place.
